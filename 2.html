            <h4>S/W Support Services</h4>
            <p>Support services form a key service for software systems, after a custom application is developed; it often becomes a crucial ingredient of a client's business process. It is imperative that the software system be efficiently maintained and any issues swiftly resolved. Additionally, the application(s) must remain functional and ready to adapt to dynamic business opportunities and requirements. Planned software evolution helps ensure your business is not left behind during the rapid technical innovation of these times. Executed support and maintenance procedures give our team valuable knowledge for advising on any software progression that may be helpful for your business processes. User support reveals the opportunity for functionality extension. Based on this knowledge, we are able to keep your business on a good strategy of software evolution.

                Code Tree offers support plans for clients who require technical support for defects for any custom software built completely by Code Tree or other third-party resources, as well as research and troubleshooting of software and infrastructure related issues. For systems built wholly or partially by third-party software providers, Code Tree team will design a plan that addresses the unique issues presented by the customized system. In most cases, this translates into substantial cost saving when compared to hiring additional IT resources and maintaining the system and network environment necessary for quality support. Code Tree offers two distinctive support plans to ensure we have the right-sized solution for your company.</p>
